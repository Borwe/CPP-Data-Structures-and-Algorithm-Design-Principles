Instructions for building the codes in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 on Linux systems
===========================================================================
Prerequisites:
Install gcc, g++, cmake, boost filesystem and boost iostreams libraries on your system.


1. Clone the repository

$ git clone https://<course webpage>/Chapter4.git

2. For most problems, we stick to compiling the given code in Debug mode as follows:

$ cd Chapter4
$ mkdir build-debug && cd build-debug
$ cmake ../
$ make -j4

3. For problems where it is specified that you are to compile the code in Release mode, it can be done with the following commands:

$ cd Chapter4
$ mkdir build-release && cd build-release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
$ make -j4
