# CPP-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Become an expert C++ programmer learning how to build applications with C++ data structures and algorithms

## What you will learn
* Build applications using hashtables, dictionaries, and sets
* Implement a URL shortening service using a bloom filter
* Implement common algorithms, such as heap sort and merge sort in string data types
* Use C++ template metaprogramming to write code libraries
* Explore how modern hardware affects the actual run-time performance of programs
* Use appropriate modern C++ idioms like std:: array instead of C-style arrays

## Hardware Requirements
For an optimal learning experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
* Memory: 4GB RAM (8 GB Preferred)
* Storage: 35 GB available space

## Software Requirements
You'll also need the following software installed in advance:
* OS: Windows 7 SP1 64-bit, Windows 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit, Ubuntu Linux, or the latest version of OS X
* Browser: Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox Latest Version
* Notepad++/Sublime Text as IDE (Optional, as you can practice everything using Jupyter note on your browser)
* Python 3.4+ (latest is Python 3.7) installed (from https://python.org)
* Python libraries as needed (Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup4, and so)
